## Project Summary
A visually refined, experience-driven web application centered around an intelligent AI agent that monitors coral reef bleaching and explains climate risk in a human-friendly way. The system feels like a living climate intelligence system, treating the AI agent as a guide that sees, understands, reasons, and explains coral health.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts, Cobe (for globe), Three-globe
- **Database/Auth**: LibSQL (Drizzle ORM), Better-Auth
- **AI Integration**: Vercel AI SDK (planned)
- **UI Components**: Radix UI, Shadcn UI patterns

## Architecture
- `src/app/`: Page routes (Home, Dashboard, Agent, Leaderboard)
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components (Globe, Charts, Agent Interaction)
- `src/lib/`: Utilities, database schema, and AI logic
- `src/hooks/`: Custom hooks for data fetching and AI state

## User Preferences
- Ocean-inspired color palette (deep blues, teals, coral accents)
- Calm, editorial, documentary-style design
- Soft motion and depth
- Fluid typography and responsive layouts

## Project Guidelines
- Minimal comments unless requested
- High visual accuracy and creative frontend choices
- Responsive and accessible design
- Use Framer Motion for micro-interactions and staggered reveals

## Common Patterns
- Progressive disclosure of information
- Story-driven navigation on the home page
