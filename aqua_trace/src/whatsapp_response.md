Hey there! 👋 Thanks so much for your crucial submission!

Here's the health diagnosis for the coral reef:
Unfortunately, the reef you've observed is experiencing a **severe case of coral bleaching**, with about 70-80% of the visible coral affected. The stark white areas indicate extreme stress, likely due to prolonged high sea temperatures (our data shows a Sea Surface Temperature of 29.5°C and significant thermal stress detected). Some areas are even showing signs of recent coral mortality and initial algal growth. This is a critical situation for the reef.

**What you can do:**
1.  **Avoid further disturbance:** Please ensure no one touches or further disturbs the affected coral.
2.  **Spread awareness:** Share this information responsibly to highlight the urgent need for climate action and reef protection.
3.  **Support conservation:** Continue reporting such observations and consider supporting local coral conservation efforts.
