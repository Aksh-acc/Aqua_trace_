**Coral Health Diagnosis: Bleaching Event Observed**

The provided image clearly depicts a coral reef ecosystem exhibiting significant signs of stress, specifically widespread coral bleaching.

**Coral Species/Types Identified (visible growth forms):**
*   **Branching Corals:** Prominently featured, particularly in the foreground and mid-ground (likely *Acropora* or *Porites* species). Many of these appear to be severely affected.
*   **Massive/Boulder Corals:** Several larger, more rounded colonies are visible in the background and integrated within the reef structure (potentially *Porites* or *Montipora* species). Some of these also show signs of paling.
*   **Encrusting Corals:** Less distinct, but some flat, plate-like growth forms appear to be present.

**Health Status:**
The dominant observation is severe to moderate coral bleaching across a substantial portion of the reef. Many coral colonies, especially the branching forms, have completely expelled their symbiotic zooxanthellae, revealing their stark white calcium carbonate skeletons. Other colonies show a lighter, paler coloration, indicating a partial loss of zooxanthellae (paling).

There are some areas where corals retain their natural vibrant colors (browns, greens, purples), suggesting healthy or less affected colonies, often among the massive coral forms or smaller patches. However, these appear to be in the minority within the scope of this image. No obvious signs of specific coral diseases (e.g., black band disease, white syndromes) or recent physical damage (e.g., breakage, abrasion marks) are distinctly visible, making bleaching the primary health concern.

**Bleaching Percentage Estimation:**
Based on the visual assessment of the live coral cover within the image, approximately **65-75%** of the corals show signs of bleaching, ranging from severe (pure white) to moderate (pale coloration). The branching corals appear particularly hard-hit, with many individual colonies being completely white. While some resilience or healthier patches exist, the overall impression is one of a reef undergoing a significant bleaching event.
