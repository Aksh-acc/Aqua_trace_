Hello there! 👋

Thanks for your vital contribution to coral reef monitoring! Your recent submission helped us diagnose a significant bleaching event. The image you provided clearly shows severe to moderate coral bleaching across 65-75% of the reef, especially affecting branching corals. This aligns with our environmental data, which indicates significant thermal stress with a sea surface temperature of 29.5°C and a Degree Heating Weeks value of 4.2.

**What you should know:**
*   The corals are experiencing high thermal stress, leading to widespread bleaching.
*   While some areas show resilience, the overall health is a major concern.

**Precautions you can take:**
*   **Avoid further stress:** If you're a diver or snorkeler, please be extra careful not to touch or disturb the corals.
*   **Report changes:** Continue to monitor and report any changes you observe, positive or negative. Your ongoing help is crucial!

On a brighter note, your detailed submission earned you **100 points** and you've unlocked the **Crisis Spotter** and **Reef Guardian** badges! 🏅 You also received a coupon code **OCEAN20-SAVE**.

Keep up the amazing work – every bit of data helps us protect these precious ecosystems! 🌊
